# Contributing to dalek-rangeproofs

If you have questions, feature requests, or comments, please feel free to join
us in IRC on OFTC in #tor-dev.

Patches are welcomed as pull requests on
[my Github](https://github.com/isislovecruft/farfetchd), as well as by
email (preferably sent to all of the authors listed in `setup.py`).

All issues on farfetchd are mentored, if you want help with a bug just ask
@isislovecruft.

Some issues are easier than others. The `easy` label can be used to find the
easy issues. If you want to work on an issue, please leave a comment so that we
can assign it to you!
